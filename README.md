# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor – Streamlit Deployment

A supervised machine learning web application built using **Streamlit** to predict the **final grade of students** based on study habits, attendance, motivation, learning style, and other educational features.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

- This project builds and deploys a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict students’ final grades.  
- The dataset contains student-related numerical and categorical features.  
- The best-performing trained model is deployed as a **Streamlit web app**.  
- Users can input student data to get real-time predictions of final grades.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations used:

- Histogram  
- Box Plot  
- Count Plot  
- Heatmap Correlation  
- Bar Plot  
- KDE Plot  

EDA helped in:

- Understanding feature distribution  
- Identifying outliers

## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning

- GridSearchCV applied for optimal parameters  
- Pipeline used to avoid data leakage  

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation included:

- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Feature Importance

## 🏆 Best Performing Model

✔ Random Forest Classifier selected as the best model  
✔ Saved using Pickle for deployment  

```python
import pickle

pickle.dump(best_rf_model, open("Models/best_rf_model.pkl", "wb"))
